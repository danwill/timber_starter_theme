# Mechanic Starter WP Theme

This is a barebones project scaffold for developing Wordpress themes. It creates a project with the following features:
* Laravel Mix - Makes webpack much more tolerable
* Timber - Enables the Twig templating engine within Wordpress templates
* ACF Pro - Provided as a distributed plugin
* Soil - Sensible Wordpress defaults
* Vue - For front-end magic

This starter theme is based on the awesome [timber-starter-theme](https://github.com/laras126/timber-starter-theme) and [lumberjack](https://github.com/Rareloop/lumberjack)


## What's here?

`assets/` contains static front-end files and images. In other words, your Sass files, JS files, SVGs, or any PNGs would live here.

`acf-json/` contains JSON files for tracking Advanced Custom Fields. This is incredibly useful for version control. After cloning this repository, you can go into Custom Fields from the Dashboard and select "Sync" to import these custom fields into your theme.

`lib/` contains files for custom post type arguments and taxonomies. These are added to WordPress inside functions.php and could be included there, but are separated into other files to keep functions.php a bit cleaner.

`views/` contains all of your Twig templates. These correspond 1 to 1 with the PHP files that make the data available to the Twig templates.

`source/` has all of your working Sass and JS files

`front-page.php` and `views/front-page.twig` are templates for a static home page should you choose to use one. This template will automatically be applied to that page whatever its name may be.

## Setup

We like using [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/valet) for serving up our local sites. Here's how to get that set up:

1. Make sure Homebrew is [installed](https://brew.sh/) and updated: `brew update`
2. Confirm that the `~/.composer/vendor/bin` directory is in your system's `PATH`
3. Install Laravel Valet by following the instructions [here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/valet)
  * Make sure PHP 7.1 is installed (`php -v`), according to the Valet instructions
4. Run `valet park` within your main project folder (e.g. `~/Sites/`)
5. Install MariaDB: `brew install mariadb`
6. Start MariaDB: `mysql.server start`
  * Note that rebooting may stop this process. To keep the service running, you can run `brew services start mariadb`. Review running services with `brew services list`. 

Finally, there are a couple of Wordpress-specific command line tools we need:
1. Install [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/)
2. Install scaffolding plugin: `wp package install aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-valet-command`

## Creating a Project

Here's how to create a new Wordpress project and clone in this starter theme to get started:

_**Note:** The following instructions are for setting up a project called **Mechanic**. Substitute in your own project name as needed._

1. In your command line, go to your project folder (e.g. `~/Sites/`), or wherever you parked Valet above.
2. Run `wp valet new mechanic --unsecure`
  * You can leave off the `--unsecure` flag to enabled HTTPS locally
  * You can change this option after the project is created using `valet secure mechanic` / `valet unsecure mechanic`
  * Full list of options available [here](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-valet-command#wp-valet-new)
3. Confirm that the site is running by going to <http://mechanic.dev>
4. `cd` into the project directory


Let's clone in this starter theme and set up some thing in Wordpress:

1. From your project folder, `cd` in the plugins folder: `cd wp-content/plugins`
2. Clone in the [Soil plugin](https://roots.io/plugins/soil/): `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/roots/soil.git --single-branch soil && rm -rf soil/.git`
3. Remove some default plugins: `wp plugin uninstall hello akismet`
4. Install Timber: `wp plugin install timber-library --activate`
5. Activate Soil: `wp plugin activate soil`
6. `cd ../themes`
  * You may want to remove the standard Wordpress themes from this directory (`open .`)
7. Clone in this theme: `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/danwill/timber_starter_theme.git mechanic && rm -rf mechanic/.git`
  * Remember to change **both** instances of _mechanic_ above to your project name!
8. `open https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/my-account/`, sign on, and download the most recent version of ACF Pro
9. Copy the contents of the ACF Pro .zip file into the theme's `acf/` directory
10. Activate the starter theme: `wp theme activate mechanic`

Now get our front-end process set up:

1. `cd` into the theme folder (e.g. `cd mechanic`)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Open up the _webpack.mix.js_ file (or use `subl webpack.mix.js`) and edit the **browsersync proxy to point to the .dev url** (e.g. <mechanic.dev>)
4. Run `npm run watch` to confirm that the source files compile successfully. The site should open up in your browser with a URL of <localhost:3000>

Git

1. We will initialize a git repo in the wp-content folder, so `cd ../..` and `git init`
2. `git add *` and `git commit - "Initial commit"`
3. If you use Tower: 
  * Open the repo in Tower with `gittower .`
  * Add a remote repo named _origin_ and paste in the link to your remote repo
4. Make your first push to your remote repo!


## Cloning

If you are a team member working on a project that someone has already created using the above steps and just need to pull down the project and get started, follow these steps:

1. In your command line, go to your project folder (e.g. `~/Sites/`), or wherever you parked Valet above.
2. Run `wp valet new mechanic --unsecure`
  * Note that you should ideally use the same settings as the rest of the team
  * You can leave off the `--unsecure` flag to enabled HTTPS locally
  * You can change this option after the project is created using `valet secure mechanic` / `valet unsecure mechanic`
  * Full list of options available [here](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-valet-command#wp-valet-new)
3. Confirm that the site is running by going to <http://mechanic.dev>
6. `cd` into the wp-content folder `cd mechanic/wp-content` and remove everything in this directory. We will clone the project repo into here.
7. `git clone your.git.repo.url.here . `
  * _Note the trailing "space period space"
8. Open in Tower, if that's your thing: `gittower .` and make sure your remote _origin_ is set up correctly
9. `wp plugin activate timber-library`
10. `wp plugin activate soil`
11. `wp theme activate mechanic`
12. `cd` into the theme folder (e.g. `cd themes/mechanic`)
13. Run `npm install`
14. Run `npm run watch` to confirm that the source files compile successfully. The site should open up in your browser with a URL of <localhost:3000>

## Extras

If you use Sublime Text and have the [CLI tools installed](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html), you may want to run `subl .` from within your new theme (e.g. `themes/mechanic`) and save the project.

6. Set a static home page in Settings > Reading and choosing "A Static Page". This will automatically act as your home page and will reference the `views/front-page.twig` template.
